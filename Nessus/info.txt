Here, I used Nessus to scan for vulnerabilities.

Pros
- sorted from highest severity level automatically
- gives detailed description of the vulnerability
- shown in a very neat UI with host details nicely placed on right column
- more accurate and faster than OpenVAS
- shows family the plugin vulnerability belongs to


Cons
- costly
- window size not scalable
- may miss out some vulnerabilities due to lack of 'deep' scan option

For Metasploitable2:

> Debain OpenSSH/OpenSSL Package Random Number Generator Weakness
> rexecd Service Detection
> Rogue Shell Backdoor Detection
> Unix Operating System Unsupported Version Detection
> VNC Server 'password' Password

  - the Advanced scan took 4 minutes
  - identified 99 vulnerabilities (5 critical, 2 high, 20 medium, 7 low, and some info levels)
  - out of 113 info severity levels, most just give additional information on services running, traceroute results, OS info etc

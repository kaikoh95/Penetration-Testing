Here, I used Nessus to scan for vulnerabilities.

Pros
- sorted from highest severity level automatically
- gives detailed description of the vulnerability
- shown in a very neat UI with host details nicely placed on right column
- faster than OpenVAS
- more accurate

Cons
- costly
- window size not scalable
- shows family the plugin vulnerability belongs to

For Metasploitable2:
- the Advanced scan took 4 minutes
- identified 99 vulnerabilities (5 critical, 2 high, 20 medium, 7 low, and some info levels)
- out of 113 info severity levels, most just give additional information on services running, traceroute results, OS info etc

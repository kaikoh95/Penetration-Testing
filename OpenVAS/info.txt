Here, I used OpenVAS to scan for vulnerabilities.

Pros
- free
- simple and straightforward UI
- open source
- able to perform deeper scans than Nessus
- shows port and location

Cons
- poorly-designed UI
- false positive exploits mixed into actual ones
- can be quite inaccurate thus
- non-intuitive; small icons without much text for description, need many clicks to find the actual report
- can be very slow with 'full and deep ultimate' mode

For Metasploitable2:

- Twiki XSS
- rexecd Service
- Java RMI Server Insecure Default Configuration
- Distributed Ruby Multiple Remote Code Execution
- Ingreslock backdoor possibility
- DistCC Remote Code Execution
- MySQL weak password
- PostgreSQL weak password

  > Full and Fast
    - took 13 minutes
    - 337 vulnerabilities (22 high, around 46 medium severity levels)
    
  > Full and Very Deep Ultimate
    - took 29 minutes
    - similar number of vulnerabilities

Used Armitage to find and execute series of exploits.

Launched NMap instense scan to re-scan for vulnerabilities as 'import host' was not working

Found the following exploits:

  Harvesting credentials
    . opened shell via one of the exploits
    . obtained password and shadow files from victim VM via cat /etc/passwd and cat/etc/shadow-
    . saved the files into local Kali dir (attacker VM)
    . used John the Ripper in Kali to unshadow the two files via unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow- > /etc/pwd.db
    . saved db into local dir
    . cracked pwd.db files (with password hashes) via john /etc/pwd.db (use john -show /etc/pwd.db to show previously cracked PWs)
    . obtained the following credentials in the following format:
        USERNAME : PASSWORD
      > postgres : postgres
      > user     : user
      > msfadmin : msfadmin
      > service  : service
      > klog     : 123456789
      > sys      : batman
    . tells us that most credentials have same username and password combination
    . successful attempt at FTP login via postgres : postgres
